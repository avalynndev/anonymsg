# ‚ö°What is Beacon In a Bottle?

**Beacon In A Bottle** is a creative message-sharing platform that lets users send ‚Äúsignals‚Äù in the form of bottles. Each bottle can carry a unique message, idea, or inspiration to be discovered by others, fostering creativity, surprise, and connection.

The concept is inspired by the classic ‚Äúmessage in a bottle,‚Äù reimagined digitally. Users can drop a bottle into the virtual ocean, and others can find it, read it, and react to it.

Here is a [video]() showcasing the platform in action.
