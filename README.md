# ‚ö°What is Beacon In a Bottle?

Beacon In A Bottle is a website that lets users send ‚Äúsignals‚Äù in the form of bottles. These bottles float the ocean and end up in some random person's hands. Each bottle can carry a message, idea or absolutely anything. Bottles get sent once every 24hrs so adjust ur timing to match a multiple of 24 (vercel restrictions).

This concept is based off "Message in a bottle" but online, increasing the number of people participating and the fun.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgEbwC3vPIA) showcasing the platform in action.
